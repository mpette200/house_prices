## House Price Prediction

I created this to practice using advanced regression techniques such as gradient boosting to predict house prices. It is based on the Ames housing dataset which is on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). The code is in Jupyter notebooks and makes use of: the scikit-learn libraries for machine learning, matplotlib seaborn plotting libraries, and lightGBM framework.

Note: Dataset not included in this repository.
